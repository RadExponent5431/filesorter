# File Sorter Script

This script automatically sorts files in your Downloads folder into designated subfolders based on their file types. It is particularly useful for organizing downloaded files, keeping your Downloads directory clean and easy to navigate.

## Features

- Automatically sorts files into folders based on their file extensions.
- Moves specific folders (like Minecraft) into designated directories.
- Handles creation of new folders if they do not exist.
- Runs continuously, checking for new files every 5 minutes.

## How It Works

The script:
1. Identifies the default Downloads directory of the current user.
2. Creates folders for different file types if they do not already exist.
3. Moves files into their respective folders based on their extensions as defined in `data.py`.
4. Continuously monitors the Downloads folder and sorts files every 5 minutes.
